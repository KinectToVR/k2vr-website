# KinectToVR website ([https://k2vr.tech](https://k2vr.tech))
This is the official website for KinectToVR and the documentation attached to it. The only framework used is Bootstrap, and jQuery where needed.

## Contributing:
Look at the existing doc pages for how to format content. There is no set way to do this, so write as you see fit and changes can be overseen in the pull request.

When creating new pages for docs, put the file at the root of the `/docs` directory even if the structure would have it deeper in subfolders. The breadcrumbs are used to signify structure in a visual sense.

Copy the template.html file, replace all mentions of `  Template` with the name of your page such as `How to fix PS Move controllers not pairing`

When naming the file itself, give it a shorter but still descriptive title all in lowercase, using dashes for spaces and with the `.html` extension. For the example above, a good filename would be `psmove-not-pairing.html`
