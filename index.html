            <p>
                Calibrating is mostly straight-forward. You just need to make sure
                <a href="#controller-bug">your controllers are working</a>
                and you should also
                <a href="#arrow">ignore the arrow</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine the Kinect is its own box in which you're tracked. And you're
                trying to line it up with the box of your VR headset.
            </p>
            <p>
                After initializing trackers, two
                checkboxes will appear towards the bottom for <strong>"Enable Kinect Rotation
                Calibration" and "Enable Kinect Position Calibration"</strong>, which let you
                rotate and move the trackers respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Enable one checkbox at a time</strong>, and with the SteamVR dashboard closed,
                use the thumbsticks/trackpads on your VR controllers to line up the
                trackers to your body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Press any of the two triggers (analog buttons on the back of your
                controllers) to confirm each calibration step. and recheck any of the
                checkboxes for rotation or position if needed until they're roughly in
                the right spot.
                <strong>Don't try to align them to a rotation you think works. only align them to your real life movements.</strong>

            <p class="remark">Ignore this when using the installer</p> -->
            <p id="white-screen">
                If launching KinectToVR while SteamVR is open gives you a white screen. Try launching it as administrator.
                Note that if this works, you should consider checking why SteamVR has to be run in an elevated state
                in the first place. Because you shouldn't need to.
            </p>
            <p id="instant-close">
                If KinectToVR immediately closes right after launching it with SteamVR open. It's possible it's due to
                the OpenVR-InputEmulator DLL fix. To attempt to fix it, find the temp folder created next to the K2VR Installer executable.
                Run the ovrie-1.3.exe file in there and let it upgrade the existing install.
            </p>
            <p id="kinect-positioning">
                When positioning the Kinect sensor,
                <strong>you want it high up (above your head preferably) and pointing down.</strong>
                Good skeleton tracking for Xbox 360 Kinect starts around 3-4 meters away from it,
                and 2-2.5 meters away for Xbox One Kinect. With that in mind you want the Kinect as far away from
                you as possible, in the angle where you’re going to play. Using the skeleton preview inside KinectToVR can be useful.
            </p>
            <div id="controller-bug">
                <p>
                    You may encounter a bug where
                    <strong>one or both of your hands in VRChat is swapped with the trackers.</strong>
                    and/or one or both of your controllers’ input to SteamVR stops working
                    (Can’t open the dashboard or click on it.) after initializing trackers.
                    If this happens, close out of KinectToVR, launch it again and initialize
                    trackers again. The controllers will start working.<br />
                    You may also need to restart K2VR if the trackers appear in the SteamVR
                    status window, but don't show up in VR.
                </p>
                <p id="k2vr-restart">
                    If the above happens to you, it means you will need to launch K2VR
                    and initialize trackers twice anytime you want to play. Hope to have
                    this fixed or find a workaround for it in the future.

                <br />
                This happens because the CustomAvatar mod requires manual configuration of each
                tracker onto the model in Unity, and KinectToVR spawns the trackers in a
                different orientation than you would put on actual Vive trackers.
                I personally recommend you use VirtualMotionCapture with the SteamVR camera config

                    Since Sharky is gone and there hasn’t been any updates in almost
                    a year. Is the software going to stop working?
                </strong>
                <br />
                Most likely not. The only dependencies are the Kinect SDK, for which
                development ended many years before K2VR even existed. And
                OpenVR-Input-Emulator which is still used by a lot of other projects and
                will continue to get fixes from the community as time goes on. If there
                ever is a need for a fix for OVRIE, I will update this document.

                <strong>What about PSMove?</strong>
                <br />
                I’ll have more info on PSMove when I get my own setup completed. For
                now, I would refer you to the folks on the D4VR Discord or the
                color-tracking channels. But do expect a full tutorial from me.
